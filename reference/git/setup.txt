NOTE: A good tutorial named as Git immersion (http://gitimmersion.com) you can follow so you can get full 
advantage of it.

NOTE: Here you see the $, this indicates commands you must type in a terminal window, besides this is a Unix/OS X/Linux 
command prompt (for windows users use the Git bash terminal window provided when you installed the git system) as a means
of standardizing tasks.

Some setup tips follow. And the snippets directory holds some other tips for git usage.

GIT Configuration basics
------------------------
1. Setup Name and Email
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"

2. Setup Line Ending Preferences (USE carefully, as this forces all files are usable in that OS).

Unix/Linux/OS X users
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
$ git config --global core.safecrlf true

Windows Users
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
$ git config --global core.safecrlf true

3. Common Aliases
By using aliases you can type fewer.
This is how it works.
Suppose you type '$ git checkout master' but you want to type less, then use an alias for checkout
and then you type '$git co master and you are done'.
To create these aliases, add the following to the .gitconfig file in your $HOME directory.
[alias]
  co = checkout
  ci = commit
  st = status
  br = branch
  hist = log --pretty=format:\"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]\" --graph --date=short
  type = cat-file -t
  dump = cat-file -p
  
To check that this works as expected type the following>
$ git config --global -l
You should see the following text
user.name=Your name
user.email=youremail@whatever.com
alias.co=checkout
alias.ci=commit
alias.st=status

SSH setup
---------
The following commands and steps are used to configure two accounts in the same computer to work with Github or
any other git server that accepts SSH.

NOTE: As a reference URL use the following https://gist.github.com/2351996
TO use the following commands use the Git command shell (windows) or a terminal in Linux/Unix/Mac OS X.

1. Create the public/private SSH keys.
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"
NOTE: Write down the file where you created the keys into.

2. Add keys to SSH repository.
$ ssh-add id_rsa_carlosorgit --> and any other you SSH key file you need.

3. Check your saved files.
$ ssh-add -l

4. Create a SSH config file to be like the following sample (remember, a sample file is located near this file).
#Default GitHub
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  
#Another user
Host github.com-carlosorgit
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_carlosorgit
  
NOTE: Read along for a usage of this step.

5. Now change the remote origin in git config files to point to the required SSH identity file.
Here let's suppose we want to use the id_rsa_carlosorgit then your config file must be set as 
[remote "origin"]
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	url = git@github.com-carlosorgit:CSoftZ/try_git.git 

Notice here that you are saying github.com-carlosorgit, thus SSH reads the ~/.ssh/config file and notices that the 
RSA files are named as id_rsa_ carlosorgit (or the one you have typed them into), thus, here, it is a good practice
to name the Host name as a suffix in the RSA file, i.e., Host=github.com-carlosorgit, RSA-File=id_rsa_carlosorgit.

As an example, here you copy the SSH url given at the github web site, e.g.,
git@github.com:CSoftZ/try_git.git and change the github.com (default host as named in the SSH config file) to
github.com-carlosorgit and not GIT will now to which credentials it will communicate to server or the other end point.

6. Create batch files or shell command files to put the user.name and user.email for the global environment settings
for git to properly mark your commit accordingly.
Here follows and example.

exec git config --global user.name "Carlos Adolfo Ortiz Quiros"
exec git config --global user.email carlosaortiz@yahoo.com 

and execute accordingly in order for your commits to be fully referenced in the social part at github.com

Lastly there is a configuration file for SSH keys in this folder for you to check out
the process.
